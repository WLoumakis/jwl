## About

The correct pronunciation of **JWL** is "jewel."  You might be wondering what **JWL** stands for; let me clear that up for you.  My name is John Walton Loumakis, hence the name of the language.  It might be a bit self-centered, but who cares -- I think it's a pretty cool name for a programming language.

**JWL** is a strongly-typed, statically-scoped, object-oriented programming language that will *hopefully* be the successor to C/C++ due to the fact that it will have remarkably similar functionality, but with some nice additions that make it a bit more user-friendly.  For example, in **JWL**, identifiers (variable/function names) allow special characters outside of the standard underscore (_), namely the hyphen (-), eroteme (?), and others (see the syntax specification section for identifiers, or view the grammar). [//] # (TODO: add section number for identifier syntax and hyperlink to the grammar)
